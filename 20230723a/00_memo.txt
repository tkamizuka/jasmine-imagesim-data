Here, we try to perform aizawa-san's simulation.

Current imagesim: master branch (commit 3c2a9f)

cp ~/jasmine-imagesim/bin/galcenimg.py ./
vi galcenimg.py
  dirname_params = "/home/kamizuka/jasmine-imagesim/params/galcenimg"

python galcenimg.py

The files were moved to case01.

The required time was not so long.
The data is not integer data, and the dark current does not seem to be considered.

Check the code.
- The code does not seem to be different very much from the usual mkimage.py.

Check the params.
- No ACE, but considering other effects.
- Nplate is set to 1.
- dark and gain are set as usual simulation.

Recheck the code.
- FITS data does not contain dark and noise, but the npz file does...

In case01
 data = np.load('img_ver1_2_B.npz')
 pf.writeto('img_ver1_2_B.npz.fits', data=data['arr_0'].T[0])


----

In case02, galcenimg.py was modified to make FITS output data including dark and noises.
In case03, galcenimg.py was modified to handle gaussian ACE.
In case04, real ACE simulation is done (galcenimg.py is the same as the one in case03,
  but parameter files are modified).
